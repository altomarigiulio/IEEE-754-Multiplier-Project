# IEEE-754-Multiplier-Project
This is a project made for Politecnico di Milano, for the Logic Networks course.

In this project I've recreated the structure of a multiplier, following the IEEE 754 standard.
The project has been developed and tested in Vivado, written in VHDL.

The relation is only available in italian.
Final Grading: 30/30.
