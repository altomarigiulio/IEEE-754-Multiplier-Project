# IEEE-754-Multiplier-Project
This is a project made for Politecnico di Milano, for the Logic Networks course.

In this project I've recreated the structure of a multiplier, following the IEEE 754 standard.
The project has been developed and tested in Vivado, written in VHDL.
## To add:

-- All components

-- The final relation (with images)

-- All the test benches (with photos of the signals)

-- Final grading

-- Tutorial on how to test it
